# useAxios
This hook exists approximately 100 times on npm, but it should combine all nice-to-have features to have a feature-complete package.

### Install
Since approximately 100 packages already exists, it was very time intensive to find a namespace to release it rather than create it. Ultimately, I just used my name for it.

```shell
pnpm i @simonkov/use-axios
```

Or just use yours.

### Roadmap
1. Improve Docs: I don't know if somebody every will use it. Currently, it's just ment for myself.
2. Add new features: Will probably never be removed from the roadmap.
